# Building ChatGPT from Scratch

This repository contains code and resources related to building OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) from scratch, based on Andrej Karpathy's instructional video.

## Description

This project aims to replicate the process of building a conversational AI model similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT using deep learning techniques. The project follows the steps outlined in Andrej Karpathy's video tutorial, providing code examples, explanations, and resources to guide users through the process.

## Contents

- `src/`: Source code for building ChatGPT from scratch.
- `data/`: Sample datasets and resources for training the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step instructions and code snippets.
- `pretrained_models/`: Pretrained models and checkpoints.
- `docs/`: Documentation and additional resources.

## Installation
